This project was a group assignment in a Javascript-course, while studying App-development at IT-HÃ¶gskolan. The project is written in ReactJS.
The assignment was to build a website which fetches data from Omdb:s rest-API. We tried to make the website resemble sites such as Netflix, Disney+ etc.
I was responsible for making the start page with underlying sections such as detailed view for movies, collections of movies and reviews of movies. I was 
also responsible for all design except on the Family-section.
